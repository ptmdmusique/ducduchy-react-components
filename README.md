## Get started

### Installation

¯\_(ツ)\_/¯ (under construction)

### Local development

1. make sure to run `npm install` once to install dependencies
2. run `npm storybook` to start the server

## Notes

1. Themes are stored in `src\components\main\theme.scss`. You can override with your custom CSS variables or even add your own theme.
2. Icon used in this project are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (free version). However, you can add Pro version and just use the corresponding prefix as well as icon names after initialization.
3. Most of the style follows [Material Design 2](https://material.io/) and [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/)
4. Styling uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
5. Form validation uses [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
